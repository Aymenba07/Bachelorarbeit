Hey Felix,

the part that you could take into consideration is methodology part, since i will write the introduction and those stuffs later on.
The work ain't ideal, specially in terms of appearance since its still ongoing and i am still modifiying it.
I have worked on data of determined large, 1M to reduce compiling time, but i could, if necessary work on the whole dataset of a year,
but i think that the results are quite meaningful.
In some analysis i didnt write that much, since i wanted to end the whole data cleaning process so i could have a better conclusions and statements.

Like we agreed last time, we won't go through modelling and evaluation steps so i think i will jump directly to experiments and results,
where i will be trying to develop scenarios and explain the usefulness as well as the princip of each scenario(bzw. gew√ºnschte Attributen)

Please write me all your feedbacks on the pdf, i will be more than happy to hear your point of view about the structure so we could 
go on the same direction :)
